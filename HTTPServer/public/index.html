    <p>If you allocate and free some memory for an object inside the same scope, then, just use defer and be happy, i.e., errdefer have no use for you in such situation. But if you allocate some memory in a scope A, but you only free this memory later, in a scope B for example, then, errdefer becomes useful to avoid leaking memory in sketchy situations.</p>
